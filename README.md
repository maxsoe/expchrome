To load your extension in Chrome,

1) Open up chrome://extensions/ from your browser URL bar
2) Click “Developer mode” in the top right
3) Click “Load unpacked extension…”
4) Select the extension’s directory.

You should now see your extension in the list.

When you change or add code in your extension, just come back to the extensions page and reload the page, or reload an extension individually.

Chrome will reload your extension.

You may need to refresh the page you're working on to ensure the new code is loaded.
